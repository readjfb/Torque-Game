# Torque-Game

**Status** *Work in progress*

## Overview
The program relies on three separate Python scripts running in parallel communicating over `python.multiprocessing` sockets. 
- program_main.py
	- The main backbone of the program. Holds the various visualization tools. Takes in data from main_data_streamer.py via a socket, saves data, and routes the data into the various visualization tools. 
	- Stores program state, and conditionally calls the tools.
	- Takes data via the remote socket, and sets the program state, saves data, and quits the program when needed. 
- admin_control.py
	- GuiZero/ TKinter remote that sets the program state, as well as can transmit other signals such as `save` or `quit.` The remote should be used to quit the program, as it does safely.
	- Transmits the signals via a socket back to program_main
- main_data_streamer.py
	- Runs at precisely a given rate, normally 1 KHz. 

## How to run it
- **Shell script** `fullRunner.sh` runs all three scripts.
- **Manually** run all three scripts simultaneously, using the correct environment. Using three separate tabs works, as does running three separate 

### Data input
Data input is generated by [main_data_streamer.py](main_data_streamer.py). Currently, program supports input from either an Arduino or generated based on arbitrary trig functions. To choose the type of input, edit the main_data_streamer file. To alter the functions, alter the [data_streamer.py](data_streamer.py) file. 

### Arduino
Current setup is with two 10K potentiometers representing the two torque inputs. data_streamer.py is configured to connect the left pot to pin A1, and the right pot to A2. Arduino is running firmata, and communicating via PyFirmata serial with Python.

## Environment
The game is being developed on macOS Mojave 10.14.6, during which there are a number of issues with Python video drivers and TKinter. I'm not sure how this will work on other operating systems, but a Conda environment with python `3.6.3` that works for the game can be found in [`environment.yml`](environment/environment.yml). Simply create a Conda environment called `torqueenv` from that file, and it *should* work. [Conda guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). 
If a wrong combination of Python version + TKinter + OS is used, the computer may crash. 

## Notes
While the data saving at 1KhZ is consistent +- 1 sample/second, the fps in the visual displays is not consistent, and the locked fps stated in each of the objects should not be relied on. Data can be stored and generated at a higher fps, if desired, but it varies based on system power. It has run at 2500 KhZ +- 3 samples/ second, but beyond that I found it to be susceptible to large drops in data save.
